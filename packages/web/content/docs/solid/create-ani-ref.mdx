title: createAniRef
description: A performant primitive that directly animates a DOM element via a ref, bypassing reactive updates.
---

This primitive is designed for high-performance animations of CSS properties. It subscribes to a timeline and applies styles directly to an element's `style` property, avoiding Solid's reactive updates for the animated element.

### Example

```tsx
import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";
import { createAniRef } from "@freestylejs/ani-solid";
import { createMemo } from "solid-js";

const InteractiveBox = () => {
  // 1. Define the animation and create a timeline.
  const myTimeline = createMemo(() =>
    a.dynamicTimeline(a.ani({ to: { x: 500, rotate: 360 }, duration: 2 }))
  );

  // 2. Use the primitive to get the ref callback and the controller.
  const [ref, controller] = createAniRef({
    timeline: myTimeline,
    initialValue: { x: 0, rotate: 0 },
  });

  // 3. The component only renders once. The animation is applied directly to the DOM.
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => controller.play({ from: { x: 0, rotate: 0 } })}>
        Play
      </button>
      <div
        ref={ref}
        style={{ width: "100px", height: "100px", background: "blue" }}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

The `createAniRef` primitive is the key to smooth, 60fps animations in Solid. It returns a `ref` callback and the timeline controller. On each animation update, it converts the values to CSS styles and applies them directly to the element's style property.

#### Example: Interactivity

For interactive animations, you can pass an `events` object. This uses a built-in `EventManager` to attach listeners to the element. Event handlers receive the timeline controller, allowing you to `play`, `pause`, etc., in response to user input.

```tsx
// ... inside a component
const [ref, controller] = createAniRef({
  timeline: myTimeline,
  events: {
    onMouseDown: (ctx, event) => {
      // The context `ctx` is the timeline controller.
      ctx.play({ from: { x: event.clientX } });
    },
    onMouseUp: (ctx) => {
      ctx.pause();
    },
  },
});
```

#### When to Use

-   **Do** use `createAniRef` for animating CSS properties like `transform` and `opacity`.
-   **Do** use it for complex, interactive animations that need to respond to user input at 60fps.
-   **Don't** use `createAniRef` if you need the animated value to render text content or pass to another component's props. Use `createAni` for that.
