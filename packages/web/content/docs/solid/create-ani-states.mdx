title: createAniStates
description: A reactive primitive for managing and transitioning between multiple animation states.
---

This primitive is a Solid-specific wrapper around the core `createStates` function. It's designed for components with multiple, distinct visual states (e.g., idle, hover, active) and provides a simple, reactive API to manage transitions between them.

### Example

```tsx
import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";
import { createAniStates, createAniRef } from "@freestylejs/ani-solid";

const StateButton = () => {
  // 1. Define the animations for each state.
  const animations = {
    idle: a.ani({ to: { scale: 1, opacity: 0.7 }, duration: 0.5 }),
    hover: a.ani({ to: { scale: 1.1, opacity: 1 }, duration: 0.3 }),
  };

  // 2. Use the primitive to create the state machine.
  // It returns reactive signals and a function to transition.
  const [{ timeline }, transitionTo] = createAniStates({
    initial: "idle",
    initialFrom: { scale: 1, opacity: 0.7 },
    states: animations,
  });

  // 3. Connect the active timeline to the DOM element for high-performance updates.
  const [animationRef] = createAniRef({ timeline });

  return (
    <button
      ref={animationRef}
      onMouseEnter={() => transitionTo("hover")}
      onMouseLeave={() => transitionTo("idle")}
      style={{ opacity: "0.7", scale: "1" }}
      class="rounded-md bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 transition-all"
    >
      Hover Me
    </button>
  );
};
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

The `createAniStates` primitive simplifies stateful animation logic in Solid. It manages the active animation state and its corresponding timeline, automatically handling seamless transitions. When you call `transitionTo`, it uses the current animation's value as the starting point for the next animation, ensuring smooth, interruptible effects.

#### When to Use

-   **Do** use `createAniStates` for components with a finite number of visual states, such as buttons, interactive cards, or navigation items.
-   **Do** combine `createAniStates` with `createAniRef` for high-performance style animations that react to state changes.
-   **Don't** create the `states` object inside a reactive computation without memoization, as this can lead to unexpected behavior.

### API Reference

#### Parameters

| Name    | Type                          | Description                                  | Default |
| :------ | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `props` | `StateProps<AnimationStates>` | The configuration object for the state machine. | —       |

#### Return Value

The primitive returns a `readonly` tuple with the following structure:

| Index | Type       | Description                                                                              |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[0]` | `object`   | An object containing signal accessors for the current `state` name and active `timeline`. |
| `[1]` | `function` | The `transitionTo` function to switch between animation states.                          |

#### Type Definitions

```typescript
import { AnimationStateShape, StateProps, GetTimeline, StateController } from '@freestylejs/ani-core';

declare function createAniStates<const AnimationStates extends AnimationStateShape>(
  props: StateProps<AnimationStates>
): readonly [
    {
        state: () => keyof AnimationStates;
        timeline: () => GetTimeline<AnimationStates>;
    },
    StateController<AnimationStates>['transitionTo']
];
```
