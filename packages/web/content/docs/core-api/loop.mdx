title: loop
description: A composition node that repeats a child animation a specified number of times.
---

A `loop` node is a composition that repeats a single child animation node a set number of times, one after another.

### Example

```typescript
import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";

// 1. Define an animation that pulses an element's scale.
const pulse = a.sequence([
    a.ani({ to: { scale: 1.2 }, duration: 0.5 }),
    a.ani({ to: { scale: 1 }, duration: 0.5 }),
]);

// 2. Create a loop to repeat the pulse animation 3 times.
const loopedPulse = a.loop(pulse, 3);

// 3. Create and play the timeline.
const myTimeline = a.timeline(loopedPulse);
myTimeline.play({ from: { scale: 1 } });
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

`loop` is a composition node that takes a single child animation and repeats it a set number of times. The total duration of the `loop` node is the duration of its child multiplied by the loop count. This is a convenient alternative to manually creating a long `sequence` of identical animations.

#### Best Practices

-   **Do** use `loop` for simple, repetitive animations like pulsing or bouncing.
-   **Don't** use `loop` for the main application loop. For continuous animations, use the `repeat: Infinity` option in the `timeline.play()` method, which is more efficient.

### API Reference

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `child` | `AnimationNode<G>` | The animation node to repeat. | — |
| `count` | `number` | The number of times to repeat the child node. | — |
| `timing` | `TimingFunction` | (Optional) An easing function to apply to the entire loop's timeline. | `linear` |
| `id` | `AnimationId` | (Optional) A unique identifier for the node. | `undefined` |

#### Type Definitions

```typescript
function loop<G>(
    child: AnimationNode<G>,
    count: number,
    timing?: TimingFunction | TimingFunction[],
    id?: AnimationId
): AnimationNode<G>;
```

-   [`timeline`](/en/docs/core-api/timeline) - The `play` method's `repeat` option provides an alternative way to loop.
-   [`sequence`](/en/docs/core-api/sequence) - Can be used to manually create loops, though `loop` is more concise.
