title: ani
description: Defines a single animation segment from a start value to an end value over a duration.
---

The `ani` function is the fundamental building block of the entire animation system.

It represents a single, atomic "tween"—a transition from a starting state to a target `to` state over a specified `duration`.

### Example

```typescript
import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";

// 1. Define a simple animation that moves an object on the x-axis.
const moveRight = a.ani({ to: { x: 100 }, duration: 0.5 });

// 2. Create a timeline to control the animation.
// The data shape `{ x: number }` is inferred from the `ani` node.
const myTimeline = a.timeline(moveRight);

// 3. Listen for updates to apply the animated values.
myTimeline.onUpdate(({ state }) => {
  // `state` is strongly typed as { x: number }
  console.log(`Current x value: ${state.x}`);
});

// 4. Play the animation from a starting state.
myTimeline.play({ from: { x: 0 } });
// Console will log 'x' increasing from 0 to 100 over 0.5 seconds.
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

The `ani` function is a **"leaf" node in the animation tree**, meaning it doesn't contain other animation nodes. All complex animations are built by composing these `ani` nodes inside "branch" nodes like `sequence` or `parallel`. The shape of the `to` object is what enforces type safety throughout the animation tree.

#### Best Practices

-   **Do** use `ani` for any individual tween.
-   **Don't** try to animate multiple, unrelated properties in a single `ani` call if they belong to different conceptual animations. Instead, use multiple `ani` nodes within a `parallel` block.

-   [`timeline`](/en/docs/core-api/timeline) - The controller required to run the animation.
-   [`sequence`](/en/docs/core-api/sequence) - To play multiple `ani` nodes one after another.
-   [`parallel`](/en/docs/core-api/parallel) - To play multiple `ani` nodes at the same time.
