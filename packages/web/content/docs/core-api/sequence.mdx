A `sequence` is a composition node that plays its child animations one after another. It enforces that all children operate on the same data shape.

### Example

```typescript
import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";

// 1. Define two separate animation segments.
const fadeIn = a.ani({ to: { opacity: 1, x: 50 }, duration: 1 });
const moveRight = a.ani({ to: { opacity: 1, x: 100 }, duration: 2 });

// 2. Create a sequence. `moveRight` will start only after `fadeIn` completes.
// The data shape `{ opacity: number, x: number }` must be consistent across all children.
const myAnimation = a.sequence([fadeIn, moveRight]);

// 3. Create a timeline to run the sequence.
const myTimeline = a.timeline(myAnimation);

// 4. Play the animation. Total duration will be 1 + 2 = 3 seconds.
myTimeline.play({ from: { opacity: 0, x: 50 } });
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

`sequence` is a "branch" composition node. Its role is to organize other animation nodes (either `ani` leaves or other branches) into a linear, chronological order. The total duration of a `sequence` is the sum of the durations of all its children.

#### Type Safety

`sequence` enforces that all its direct children operate on the same data shape `G`. This is a core feature that prevents you from sequencing animations with incompatible data types, catching errors at compile time.

> **Note:** The type inference for `G` is based on the *first* element in the children array. If subsequent elements have a different shape, TypeScript will raise an error.

#### Best Practices

-   **Do** use `sequence` for multi-stage animations, like an element fading in and then moving.
-   **Don't** use `sequence` if you just need two properties to animate at the same time. Use `parallel` for that.
