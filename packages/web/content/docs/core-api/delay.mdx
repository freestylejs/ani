title: delay
description: A node that introduces a pause in an animation sequence.
---

The `delay` function is a simple utility node that creates a pause in an animation. It is a declarative and readable way to create a delay within a `sequence`.

### Example

```typescript
import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";

// 1. Define an animation that fades in, waits, and then moves.
const myAnimation = a.sequence([
  a.ani({ to: { opacity: 1, x: 0 }, duration: 0.5 }),
  a.delay(1), // 2. Wait for 1 second.
  a.ani({ to: { opacity: 1, x: 100 }, duration: 1 }),
]);

// 3. Create and play the timeline.
const myTimeline = a.timeline(myAnimation);
myTimeline.play({ from: { opacity: 0, x: 0 } });
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

`delay` is a simple utility node that does nothing for a specified `duration`. Its primary purpose is to insert pauses within a `sequence` composition. It is a "leaf" node, similar to `ani`, but it does not affect any values.

#### Best Practices

-   **Do** use `delay` inside a `sequence` to create a pause between two animations.
-   **Don't** use `delay` inside a `parallel` block, as it will have no effect on other parallel animations. It will simply extend the total duration of the `parallel` block if it is the longest item.
