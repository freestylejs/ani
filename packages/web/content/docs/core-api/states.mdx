description: Creates a state machine to manage and transition between different animations.
---

The `createStates` function is a high-level utility for managing complex animation logic. It allows you to define a set of named animation trees and provides a simple API for seamless transitions between them.

### Example

```typescript
import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";

// 1. Define different animation structures for each named state.
const animations = {
  inactive: a.ani({ to: { scale: 1, opacity: 0.5 }, duration: 0.5 }),
  active: a.ani({ to: { scale: 1.2, opacity: 1 }, duration: 0.3 }),
};

// 2. Create a state machine controller with an initial state and initial values.
const myStates = a.createStates({
  initial: 'inactive',
  initialFrom: { scale: 1, opacity: 0.5 }, // The starting point for the first animation
  states: animations,
});

// 3. Listen for updates from the currently active timeline.
myStates.timeline().onUpdate(({ state }) => {
    console.log(state.scale);
});

// 4. Transition to a new state. This will smoothly switch to the 'active' animation.
myStates.transitionTo('active');
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

`createStates` is ideal for UI components with multiple visual states (e.g., hover, active, disabled, selected) or complex character animations. When you call `transitionTo`, it intelligently retrieves the current animation's values and uses them as the `from` point for the new state's animation, ensuring graceful and seamless transitions rather than abrupt cuts.

#### The Controller

The `createStates` function returns a controller object with the following methods:

-   `timeline()`: Returns the currently active `timeline` instance. Use this to subscribe to updates or control playback manually (e.g., `myStates.timeline().pause()`).
-   `transitionTo(newState, [timelineConfig], [canBeIntercepted])`: Switches to a different animation state. You can optionally provide a `timelineConfig` object (similar to `timeline.play()`) to customize the transition's duration, keyframes, or repeat count. `canBeIntercepted` determines if the transition will occur even if the timeline is already playing.
-   `onTimelineChange(callback)`: Registers a callback that fires whenever the active timeline changes (i.e., after a `transitionTo` call). This is useful for reacting to global state changes managed by `createStates`.

#### Best Practices

-   **Do** use `createStates` to manage distinct visual states of a component, especially when smooth transitions between states are required.
-   **Do** provide a sensible `initialFrom` value that matches the component's initial appearance.
-   **Don't** manually manage multiple `timeline` instances and their transitions; `createStates` is designed to abstract this complexity.
-   **Don't** create a new `createStates` instance frequently; it should be initialized once for a given set of states.
