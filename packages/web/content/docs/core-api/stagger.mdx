---

A `stagger` node is a composition that plays its child animations in sequence, but with a fixed delay between the start of each one.

### Example

```typescript
import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";

// 1. Define the animation for a single list item.
const itemAnimation = a.ani({ to: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }, duration: 0.5 });

// 2. Create a stagger animation for three items.
// Each subsequent animation will start 0.1s after the previous one.
const listEntrance = a.stagger(
  [
    itemAnimation, // for item 1
    itemAnimation, // for item 2
    itemAnimation, // for item 3
  ],
  { offset: 0.1 }
);

// 3. Create a timeline.
const myTimeline = a.timeline(listEntrance);

// 4. Play the animation.
// Note: The `from` value applies to all three conceptual items.
myTimeline.play({ from: { opacity: 0, y: 20 } });
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

`stagger` is a specialized composition node for creating cascading or "domino" effects, typically used for lists of elements. It runs its child animations in order, but delays the start of each subsequent animation by a fixed `offset` time. It's essentially a `sequence` with a built-in, regular delay.

#### Best Practices

-   **Do** use `stagger` for animating lists of items into or out of view.
-   **Don't** use `stagger` if you need variable delays between animations; build a custom `sequence` with `delay` nodes instead.
