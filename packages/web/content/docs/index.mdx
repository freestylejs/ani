**FreestyleJS Ani** is a declarative and compositional animation library designed for the modern web. It provides a set of powerful, type-safe primitives to define complex animation structures that can be reused and controlled with precision, offering dedicated, high-performance bindings for React, Solid, Svelte, and Vue.

The core philosophy is to **separate an animation's declarative structure from its imperative execution**. You define a complex animation *once* as a static tree, and then use a controller to play it many times with different runtime values.
