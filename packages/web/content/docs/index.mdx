## Philosophy

**FreestyleJS Ani** is a declarative animation library designed for the modern web.

The core philosophy is to **separate an animation's declarative structure from its imperative execution**.

You define a complex animation *once* as a **static tree**, and then use a controller to play it many times with different runtime values.

### What is Animation Tree?

![animation-tree](/ani.png)

Let's start with some animation keyframes. As you can see above this is kind tricky for defining the structure of animation using code. 

But using ani, you can create this animation tree easily.

```ts
import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core"

const animationTree = a.loop(
  a.stagger(
    [
      // 1. First Group: Parallel execution of Translate X, Rotate, and Skew
      a.parallel([
          a.ani({ to: { translateX: 100 }, duration: 1.5 }),  // Translate X
          a.sequence([
            a.delay(0.75)                                     // Delay 0.75s
            a.ani({ to: { rotate: 180 }, duration: 0.75 }),   // Rotate
          ]),
          a.sequence([
            a.delay(0.75)                                     // Delay 0.75s
            a.ani({ to: { translateX: 20 }, duration: 1.5 }), // Skew
          ]),
      ]),
      
      // 2. Second Group: Parallel execution of Translate X and Translate Y
      a.parallel([
          a.ani({ to: { translateX: 0 }, duration: 1 }),      // Translate X
          a.sequence([
            a.delay(0.5)                                      // Delay 0.5s
            a.ani({ to: { translateY: 50 }, duration: 1 }),   // Translate Y
          ]),
      ]),
    ],
    0.75, // Offset: Wait 0.5s before starting the second group
  ),
  3 // Loop: Repeat the entire sequence 3 times
)
```

Yes, after this part you can create static animation keyframes using `timeline`.

```ts
const timeline = a.timeline(animationTree)

// You can now, have full control of animation tree.

timeline.play(targetElement, {
  from: {
    translateX: 0,
    translateY: 0,
    rotate: 0,
  } // set start values.
})
```

## 6x Smaller Bundle Size, but Powerful.

It is also much smaller compared to other animation libraries.

- `ani` = [**4.8kB**](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@freestylejs/ani-core)
- `motion` = 31.1kB
- `anime.js` = 30.8kB
- `gsap` = 26.6kB
