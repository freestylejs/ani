title: useAniRef
description: A performant hook that directly animates a DOM element via a ref, bypassing React renders.
---

This hook is designed for high-performance animations of CSS properties. It subscribes to a timeline and applies styles directly to an element's `style` property, avoiding the overhead of re-rendering the component on every frame.

### Example

```tsx
import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";
import { useAniRef } from "@freestylejs/ani-react";
import { useMemo, useRef } from "react";

const InteractiveBox = () => {
  // 1. Create a ref to attach to the DOM element.
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  // 2. Define the animation and create a timeline.
  const myTimeline = useMemo(
    () => a.dynamicTimeline(a.ani({ to: { x: 500, rotate: 360 }, duration: 2 })),
    []
  );

  // 3. Use the hook to get the controller and bind the animation to the ref.
  const controller = useAniRef(ref, {
    timeline: myTimeline,
    initialValue: { x: 0, rotate: 0 },
  });

  // 4. The component only renders once. The animation is applied directly to the DOM.
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => controller.play({ from: { x: 0, rotate: 0 } })}>
        Play
      </button>
      <div ref={ref} style={{ width: 100, height: 100, background: "blue" }} />
    </>
  );
};
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

The `useAniRef` hook is the key to smooth, 60fps animations. It takes a React `ref` and an animation configuration. On each frame, it converts the animation values to CSS styles (e.g., `{ x: 100 }` becomes `transform: translateX(100px)`) and writes them directly to the DOM element.

#### Example: Interactivity

For interactive animations, you can pass an `events` object. This uses a built-in `EventManager` to attach listeners to the element. Event handlers receive the timeline controller, allowing you to `play`, `pause`, etc., in response to user input.

```tsx
// ... inside a component
const controller = useAniRef(ref, {
  timeline: myTimeline,
  events: {
    onMouseDown: (ctx, event) => {
      // The context `ctx` is the timeline controller.
      ctx.play({ from: { x: event.clientX } });
    },
    onMouseUp: (ctx) => {
      ctx.pause();
    },
  },
});
```

#### When to Use

-   **Do** use `useAniRef` for animating CSS properties like `transform` and `opacity`.
-   **Do** use it for complex, interactive animations that need to respond to user input at 60fps.
-   **Don't** use `useAniRef` if you need the animated value to render text content or pass to a child component's props. Use `useAni` for that.
