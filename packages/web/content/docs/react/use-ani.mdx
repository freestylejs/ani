title: useAni
description: A reactive hook that syncs an animation's state with a component's render cycle.
---

This hook subscribes to a `timeline`'s state and triggers a component re-render on each animation frame, making it ideal for animations that drive UI content.

### Example

```tsx
import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";
import { useAni } from "@freestylejs/ani-react";
import { useMemo } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  // 1. Define the animation and create a timeline instance.
  const myTimeline = useMemo(
    () => a.dynamicTimeline(a.ani({ to: { count: 100 }, duration: 5 })),
    []
  );

  // 2. Use the hook to get the reactive value and the controller.
  const [value, controller] = useAni(myTimeline, { count: 0 });

  // 3. The component re-renders on each frame, updating the display.
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {Math.round(value.count)}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => controller.play({ from: { count: 0 } })}>
        Start
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

The `useAni` hook acts as a bridge between the `@freestylejs/ani-core` engine and React's render cycle. It uses React's `useSyncExternalStore` internally to efficiently subscribe to the external animation state. On each frame, it provides the updated animation value, triggering a re-render.

#### When to Use

-   **Do** use `useAni` when the animated values need to be part of React's state and render flow.
-   **Do** use it for animations that affect text content, attributes, or props of other components.
-   **Don't** use `useAni` for high-frequency style updates (like `transform` or `opacity`). Use `useAniRef` for those cases to avoid performance overhead.

-   [`useAniRef`](/en/docs/react/use-ani-ref) - For performance-critical animations that write directly to the DOM.
-   [`timeline`](/en/docs/core-api/timeline) - The core controller that this hook subscribes to.
