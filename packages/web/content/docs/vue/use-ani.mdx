description: A reactive composable that updates a Vue ref on each animation frame.
---

This composable subscribes to a `timeline`'s state and updates a Vue `ref` on each animation frame. It's ideal when animated values need to be read within your component's template or other reactive computations.

### Example

```vue
<script setup>
import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";
import { useAni } from "@freestylejs/ani-vue";

// 1. Define the animation structure and create a timeline.
const myTimeline = a.dynamicTimeline(
  a.ani({ to: { count: 100 }, duration: 5, timing: a.timing.linear() })
);

// 2. Use the composable to get the reactive ref and controller.
const [value, controller] = useAni(myTimeline, { count: 0 });

// 3. Play the animation.
function handlePlay() {
  controller.play({ from: { count: 0 } });
}
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <!-- 4. The ref's value is automatically unwrapped in the template. -->
    <h1>Counter: {{ Math.round(value.count) }}</h1>
    <button @click="handlePlay">Start</button>
  </div>
</template>
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

The `useAni` composable acts as a bridge between the `@freestylejs/ani-core` engine and Vue's reactivity system. It takes a `timeline` instance and an `initialValue`, returning a reactive Vue `ref` that is updated with the latest animation value, alongside the timeline's controller. Vue's reactivity system automatically tracks this `ref` and updates the component whenever its value changes.

#### When to Use

-   **Do** use `useAni` when you need the animated values to be part of Vue's reactive system.
-   **Do** use it for animations that affect text content, attributes, or props.
-   **Don't** use `useAni` for high-frequency style updates on a single element. For that, `useAniRef` is a better choice.
