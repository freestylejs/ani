title: useAniRef
description: A performant, event-driven Svelte action that binds animations directly to a DOM element.
---

This primitive applies animation styles directly to a DOM element using the `use:` directive, bypassing Svelte's reactivity for high performance. It also includes a built-in event manager to simplify interactive animations.

### Example

```svelte
<script>
  import { a } from '@freestylejs/ani-core';
  import { useAniRef } from '@freestylejs/ani-svelte';

  // 1. Define the animation structure and timeline.
  const myTimeline = a.dynamicTimeline(
    a.sequence([
      a.ani({ to: { x: 500, rotate: 360 }, duration: 1 }),
      a.ani({ to: { x: 0, rotate: 0 }, duration: 1 }),
    ])
  );

  // 2. Use the utility to get the action and controller.
  const [refAction, controller] = useAniRef({
    timeline: myTimeline,
    initialValue: { x: 0, rotate: 0 },
    // 3. Add event handlers for interactivity.
    events: {
      onMousedown: (ctx, event) => {
        // The context `ctx` contains the current animation value and the controller.
        ctx.play({ from: { x: ctx.x, rotate: ctx.rotate } });
      },
      onMouseup: (ctx) => {
        ctx.pause();
      },
    },
  });
</script>

<!-- 4. Bind the action to the element -->
<div use:refAction style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background: blue;" on:click={() => controller.play({ from: { x: 0, rotate: 0 } })} />
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

The `useAniRef` primitive is designed for performance. It takes a configuration object (`AniRefProps`) and returns a Svelte `Action` and the timeline controller. When the action is applied to an element, it directly manipulates its styles on each animation frame, avoiding Svelte's virtual DOM overhead.

Event handlers passed to the `events` property receive a context object containing both the current animation value and the timeline controller, making it easy to build complex interactions.

#### When to Use

-   **Do** use `useAniRef` for high-performance animations of CSS properties like `transform` and `opacity`.
-   **Do** use it for complex, interactive animations driven by user input at 60fps.
-   **Don't** use `useAniRef` when you need to read the animated values elsewhere in your component. Use `useAni` for that.
