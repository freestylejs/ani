title: useAniStates
description: A reactive primitive for managing and transitioning between multiple animation states.
---

This primitive is a Svelte-specific wrapper around the core `createStates` function. It's designed for components with multiple, distinct visual states (e.g., idle, hover, active) and provides a simple, reactive API to manage transitions between them.

### Example

```svelte
<script>
  import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";
  import { useAniStates } from "@freestylejs/ani-svelte";

  // 1. Define the animations for each state.
  const animations = {
    idle: a.ani({ to: { scale: 1, opacity: 0.7 }, duration: 0.5 }),
    hover: a.ani({ to: { scale: 1.1, opacity: 1 }, duration: 0.3 }),
  };

  // 2. Use the primitive to create the state machine. It returns the action,
  // reactive stores for state info, and a function to transition.
  const [refAction, { timeline }, transitionTo] = useAniStates({
    initial: "idle",
    initialFrom: { scale: 1, opacity: 0.7 },
    states: animations,
  });
</script>

<button
  use:refAction
  on:mouseenter={() => transitionTo("hover")}
  on:mouseleave={() => transitionTo("idle")}
  style="opacity: 0.7; scale: 1"
  class="rounded-md bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 transition-all"
>
  Hover Me
</button>
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

The `useAniStates` primitive simplifies stateful animation logic in Svelte. It manages the active animation state and its corresponding timeline, automatically handling seamless transitions. When you call `transitionTo`, it uses the current animation's value as the starting point for the next animation, ensuring smooth, interruptible effects.

#### When to Use

-   **Do** use `useAniStates` for components with a finite number of visual states, such as buttons, interactive cards, or navigation items.
-   **Do** combine `useAniStates` with `useAniRef` for high-performance style animations that react to state changes.
-   **Don't** create the `states` object inside a reactive computation without memoization, as this can lead to unexpected behavior.

-   [`useAniRef`](/en/docs/svelte/use-ani-ref) - To apply the stateful animations to the DOM.
-   [`useAni`](/en/docs/svelte/use-ani) - To reactively read the animation values from the active timeline.
