title: useAni
description: A Svelte utility that creates a reactive store to track the state of an animation timeline.
---

This primitive subscribes to a `timeline`'s state and exposes it as a readable Svelte store. It's ideal when animated values need to be used within your component's markup or other reactive computations.

### Example

```svelte
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';
  import { a } from "@freestylejs/ani-core";
  import { useAni } from '@freestylejs/ani-svelte';

  // 1. Define the animation structure and create a timeline.
  const myTimeline = a.dynamicTimeline(
    a.ani({ to: { count: 100 }, duration: 5, timing: a.timing.linear() })
  );

  // 2. Use the utility to get the readable store and controller.
  const [value, controller] = useAni(myTimeline, { count: 0 });

  // 3. Play the animation on component mount.
  onMount(() => {
      controller.play({ from: { count: 0 } });
  })
</script>

<div>
  <!-- 4. The animated value is read from the store via auto-subscription. -->
  <h1>Counter: {Math.round($value.count)}</h1>
  <button on:click={() => controller.play({ from: { count: 0 } })}>
    Start
  </button>
</div>
```

### Usage & Concepts

#### Overview

The `useAni` primitive acts as a bridge between the `@freestylejs/ani-core` engine and Svelte's reactivity model. It takes a `timeline` instance and an `initialValue`, returning a readable Svelte store that updates on every animation frame, along with the timeline's controller. You can auto-subscribe to the store's value using the `$` prefix.

#### When to Use

-   **Do** use `useAni` when you need the animated values to be part of Svelte's reactive system.
-   **Do** use it for animations that affect text content, attributes, or props.
-   **Don't** use `useAni` for high-frequency style updates on a single element. For that, `useAniRef` is a better choice.
